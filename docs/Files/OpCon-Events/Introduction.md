# Introduction

Events are strings that execute commands within
OpCon. Events can be defined to execute upon
Schedule Completion, Job Statuses, String Match on LSAM Feedback for
Jobs, Job Exit Description, Event Triggers from the Notification
Manager, and external events. These events cause the SAM to take a
number of different actions.

 

Any number of events may be defined for each job. Events can be defined
at the job or at the frequency level. All events can be passed to the
SAM externally through [MSGIN](Defining-Events.md#MSGIN){.MCXref
.xref}.
