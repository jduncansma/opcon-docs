#  Access Codes

Access codes can be used to secure individual job records. The access
code object is simply a name. To make use of an access code, privileges
must be granted (refer to [Access Code Privileges](Access-Code-Privileges.md)), and the
access code must be associated with the jobs needing this type of
security (refer to [Jobs](Jobs.md)). A single access
code can be used to secure as many different jobs as necessary.

 

The following information applies to defining access codes:

-   **Name**: Defines the name for the access code.
-   **Documentation**: Provides an area for descriptions and notes for
    the access code. For information on inserting hyperlinks into the
    Documentation area, refer to [Entering and Opening Hyperlinks in the     Documentation
    Frame](../UI/Enterprise-Manager/Entering-and-Opening-Hyperlinks.md){.MCXref
    .xref} in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.
