#  Documentation

The *documentation* for each job is user-defined information (e.g.,
command history, instructions for operators in case of failure, etc.).
Documentation can be associated with the job or with individual
frequencies for the job. Frequency-level documentation can only be added
after at least one frequency has been defined.

 

The following information applies to documentation associated with the
job:

-   **Schedule Name**: Defines the name of the schedule.
-   **Job Name**: Defines the name of the job.
-   **Job Documentation**: Contains the user-defined information that is
    always associated with the job.
-   **Frequency Name**: Defines the name of the frequency if the
    documentation is defined for a specific frequency. The list box
    contains the names of all frequencies defined for the selected job
    in order of priority.
-   **Frequency Documentation**: Contains the user-defined information
    that is associated the Frequency Name and included with the job only
    when the job runs with the associated frequency.
