Roles are used to maintain privileges for multiple User Accounts at the
same time. Managing privileges through Roles provides easy
administration of User Accounts.

 

A user must be a member of a role with All Administrative Functions, All
Function Privileges, or must be in the ocadm role to manage roles.

 

The following information applies to Role management:

-   **Role Name**: Defines the unique name of the Role.
-   **Documentation**: Provides an area to store a description of the
    Role.
-   **Inherit Privileges for All Schedules**: Determines if the Role
    inherits privileges to all current and future schedules in the
    OpCon database. If this setting is
    cleared, the Role retains previously inherited schedule privileges.
-   **Inherit Privileges for All Machines**: Determines if the Role
    inherits privileges to all current and future Machines in the
    OpCon database. If this setting is
    cleared, the Role retains previously inherited Machine privileges.
-   **Inherit Privileges for All Machine Groups**: Determines if the
    Role inherits privileges to all current and future Machine Groups in
    the OpCon database. If this setting is
    cleared, the Role retains previously inherited Machine Group
    privileges.
-   **Inherit Privileges for All Scripts**: Determines if the Role
    inherits privileges to all current and future Embedded Scripts in
    the OpCon database. If this setting is
    cleared, the Role retains previously inherited Embedded Script
    privileges.
-   **User Assignment**: Provides the User Accounts assigned to the Role
    Name. A User Account must have at least one assigned role to be able
    to log in. Refer to [User Accounts](User-Accounts.md){.MCXref
    .xref}.

The following areas need to be addressed to grant a Role all needed
privileges:

-   [Access Code Privileges](Access-Code-Privileges.md){.MCXref
    .xref}
-   [Function Privileges](Function-Privileges.md)
-   [Machine Privileges](Machine-Privileges.md)
-   [Machine Group Privileges](Machine-Group-Privileges.md){.MCXref
    .xref}
-   [Schedule Privileges](Schedule-Privileges.md)
-   [Batch User Privileges](Batch-User-Privileges.md){.MCXref
    .xref}
