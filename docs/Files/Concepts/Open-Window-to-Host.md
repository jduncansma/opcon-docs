#  Open Window to Host

The Open Window to Host feature provides a way to open an emulator for a
remote connection to a machine defined in
OpCon. Configure the preferences in the
Enterprise Manager to set the different commands for each platform to
call when executing the **Window to Host** shortcut from the Operation
views. For more information, refer to [Setting Preferences for Window To Host](../UI/Enterprise-Manager/Preferences-for-Windows-To-Host.md){.MCXref
