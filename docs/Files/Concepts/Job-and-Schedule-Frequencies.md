#  Job and Schedule Frequencies

Frequencies specify the recurring days on which a schedule or a job
should run. Frequencies are defined with a schedule or with a job in the
Master, and are used during the Schedule Build process to determine
which jobs should be run on a given day.

 

While a job frequency applies to an individual job, a schedule frequency
applies to all jobs in a schedule. The following are the general
characteristics of schedule and job frequencies:

-   A schedule frequency is the frequency for all existing and future
    jobs in a schedule.
-   Additions, deletions, and modifications of a schedule frequency
    affect all jobs on a schedule.
