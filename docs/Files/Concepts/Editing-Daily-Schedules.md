#  Editing Daily Schedules

Editing Daily Schedules is the process of modifying jobs and schedules
in the Daily tables. Each change only affects the defined iteration of
the job or schedule. The change does not affect Job Master information
for the job or schedule and does not affect any occurrences of the
defined job or schedule on any other date in the Daily tables. For
example, if the start time for a job is changed from 19:00 to 20:00 in
the Daily tables using this feature, it only affects the specific
occurrence of the defined job on the defined date; all other executions
of the defined job would still occur at 19:00.

 

The following schedule information can be modified when editing Daily
schedules:

-   Schedule Start Time
-   Schedule Completion Events
-   Available properties for the schedule instance

The following job information can be modified when editing Daily
schedules:

-   General and platform-specific job details
-   All Job Automation components for the job instance
-   Available properties for the job instance

Users can also delete jobs from the Daily schedules.
