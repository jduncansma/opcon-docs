#  Departments

Departments can be used to secure function privileges associated with
individual job records. The department object is simply a name. To make
use of a department, function privileges must be granted (refer to
[OpCon User Account and Role Management](OpCon-User-Account-and-Role-Management.md#Departmental_Function_Privileges){.MCXref
.xref}), and the access code must be associated with the jobs needing
this type of security (refer to [Jobs](Jobs.md)). A
single department can be used to secure as many different jobs as
necessary.

 

The following information applies to defining departments:

-   **Name**: Defines the name for the defined department.
-   **Documentation**: Provides an area for descriptions, explanations,
    and notes that can be updated for the department. For information on
    inserting hyperlinks into the Documentation area, refer to [Entering     and Opening Hyperlinks in the Documentation
    Frame](../UI/Enterprise-Manager/Entering-and-Opening-Hyperlinks.md){.MCXref
    .xref} in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.
