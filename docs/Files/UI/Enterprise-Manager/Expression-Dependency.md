#  Expression Dependency

The **Expression Dependency** tab allows you to define and maintain job
dependencies on expressions using the Property Expressions API. Within
the tab, you will be able to:

-   [Add Expression     Dependencies](Adding-Expression-Dependencies.md)
-   [Edit Expression     Dependencies](Editing-Expression-Dependencies.md)
-   [Delete Expression     Dependencies](Deleting-Expression-Dependencies.md)

For conceptual information, refer to [Property Expressions API Syntax](../../Concepts/Property-Expressions-API-Syntax.md){.MCXref
.xref} in the **Concepts** online help. For examples and use cases,
refer to the [Use Cases](../../Concepts/Property-Expressions-API-Syntax.md#Use){.MCXref
.xref} section.
