#  Job Instance Definition

The **Instance Definition** tab in the [**Job Master**](Using-Job-Master.md) editor allows you to define and
manage job instance properties. Within the tab, you will be able to:

-   [Define Properties for Single Instance     Jobs](Defining-Properties-for-Single-Instance-Jobs.md)
-   [Define Properties for Multi-Instance     Jobs](Defining-Properties-for-Multi-Instance-Jobs.md)
-   [Update Job Instance     Properties](Updating-Job-Instance-Properties.md)
-   [Delete Job Instance     Properties](Deleting-Job-Instance-Properties.md)

For conceptual information, refer to [Instance Definition](../../Concepts/Instance-Definition.md) in
the **Concepts** online help.
